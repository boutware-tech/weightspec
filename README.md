System for managing and tracking weight loss for athletics. This is mostly targetted towards sports like wrestling, boxing, judo, etc.

## Requirements
1. **Athlete identity data**  
   The system will maintain the minimal amount of data to identity an athlete (_ex : id, first-name, last-name, date-of-birth_). Detailed identity-type data, as well as team and roster data, will be sourced from another system. 
2. **Athlete body measurements**  
   The system will maintain records of data per athlete for weight management purposes. This could include the athlete's weight, hydration level, body fat, and skin fold measurements (for body fat analysis).
3. **Audit records**  
4. **Challenge and Appeals**  
5. **Competition weigh-in data**  
6. **Roles**
